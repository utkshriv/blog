# Hello World

This is the start of my redemption arc. After facing rejection, I realized that the only way forward is through rigorous practice and documented growth.

## The Goal

I will be solving LeetCode problems, building projects, and documenting everything here. This blog, "botthef", is my commitment to the process.

## The Tech

This site is built with:
- Next.js 15
- Vanilla CSS (Premium Dark Theme)
- MDX for content

Strap in. It's going to be a long ride.

```javascript
console.log("Transformation initialized...");
```
